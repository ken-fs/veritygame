      question: "What is Verity's Game on Roblox?",
      answer:
        "Verity's Game is a box-hunting collection game by Slime Time Studios (released September 4, 2026). A big field of boxes generates cash, some boxes are 'incredibly extremely rare', and the official description jokingly warns you to leave them alone. It passed 15 million visits in 24 days; concurrent players peaked above 9,200 on Sept 19 and sit around 3,100 as of Sept 28 — Steal A Verity! (11.5K online, 453K favorites after back-to-back [BOSS] updates) remains the most-played Verity game on Roblox.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is Verity's Game the same as Verity?",
      answer:
        "No. The original Verity is a 3-day survival horror game by The ROBO Studio!. Verity's Game is a separate box-hunting title by Slime Time Studios riding the same hype — different gameplay, different developer. The original's badge and ending guides are on this site.",

        <h2>What We Know</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the name, Verity&apos;s Game is <strong>not a horror game like the original</strong> — it&apos;s a
          box-hunting collection game riding the Verity hype wave. The entire official description reads:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          &ldquo;Welcome to my game where nothing bad will happen and there&apos;s a big field full of boxes that are all
          mine so leave them alone even though they make you cash and even though some of them are incredibly
          extremely rare just leave them alone. 🙂&rdquo;
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Reading between the 🙂: the map is a <strong>big field of boxes</strong> that generate cash, some boxes are
          <strong> incredibly extremely rare</strong>, and you&apos;re officially told to leave them alone — the community
          sums it up as <em>&ldquo;Steal An Egg but Verity&rdquo;</em>. The official artwork shows a giant yellow
          smiley-face sphere looming over a tiny player, watching its boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers are real: released September 4, 2026, it passed <strong>15 million visits</strong> in 24 days;
          concurrent players peaked above <strong>9,200</strong> on Sept 19 and sit at ~3,100 as of Sept 28 (Roblox
          public API snapshot) — on tiny 5-player servers. Steal A Verity! answered with back-to-back [BOSS] updates
          on Sept 24 and 27 and pulled away to ~11,500 online, gaining 50K favorites in a single day (453K total),
          while Build Base&apos;s back-to-back updates (Sept 26 and 28) kept it ahead of Verity&apos;s Game in #2.

        <p>
          The striking takeaway: the original <strong>Verity™</strong> has cooled to under 30 concurrent players
          while <strong>Steal A Verity!</strong> — after back-to-back [BOSS] updates on Sept 24 and 27 — holds #1 at
          ~11.5K players and jumped from 402K to 453K favorites in a single day (the most-favorited game in the
          ecosystem). <strong>Build Base to Survive VERITY</strong> followed its Sept 26 surge (doubling to ~7,300)
          with another update on Sept 28, keeping #2. Verity&apos;s Game still adds visits faster than any spinoff
          (15M in 24 days) — which is why this page tracks the whole ecosystem, not just the original.

        <h2>What We&apos;re Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          No guide, wiki or video coverage of Verity&apos;s Game mechanics exists anywhere yet (source-checked Sept 28).
          These are the open questions — <strong>unverified, we publish nothing until confirmed</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Box tiers &amp; odds</strong> — tier names beyond normal vs &ldquo;incredibly extremely rare&rdquo;, cash amounts, rarity rates</li>
          <li><strong>The smiley sphere</strong> — what the giant yellow face in the artwork actually does in gameplay</li>
          <li><strong>Stealing</strong> — whether other players can take your boxes, &ldquo;Steal An Egg&rdquo; style</li>
          <li><strong>Codes</strong> — none confirmed for either game; checked daily (see <a href="/codes">codes status</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>Updates</strong> — last game update Sept 26, 2026 (the third in a week, after Sept 21 and 24): no description change, still zero badges (live badge API, Sept 28) and no official changelog — contents still undocumented; new content drops land here first</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          New to the sphere universe? The original&apos;s <a href="/walkthrough">3-day walkthrough</a> is the fastest
